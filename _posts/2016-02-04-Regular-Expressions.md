This post will infact link to my good friend's post [Pranabesh](http://prnbs.github.io/projects/2016/01/01/regular-expression-parser/) about regular expression. Both of us took up the challenge of implementing a regular expression engine. We implemented in both Scala and python but pretty soon the scala code became unreadable. So we transitioned to python.
